# Sketcher

Sketcher is a customized drawing tool similar to Etch-A-Sketch.
The user can draw designs on a dynamically sized grid. As the cursor 
hovers over a square, that square changes to a randomly generated color.

At any time, the user may clear the grid to begin a new drawing, or 
create a new grid of their desired width/height (between 1 and 100).
